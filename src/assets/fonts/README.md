### License Notice

-   The font on the [Figma spec](https://www.figma.com/design/1flpTvsVFD6DDRFnIpEtlw/App-Developer-Assignment) is actually private, and doesn't have a free use license
-   I purchased a personal license; However I am not permitted to attach this license on a publicly available `source code`
-   I will be building the `.APK` file as requested in the Task,
    -   However, I will not be checking in the font file in `VCS`
    -   Please ensure to attach a font file by the name `CallingCode-Regular.otf` in this folder when building
        -   Since the one I am licensed to use is not a part of this `GitHub` repo
        -   My `.APK` file submission would look like an exact replica of the `Figma` schema
        -   But building this project locally without that file, will not look the same
