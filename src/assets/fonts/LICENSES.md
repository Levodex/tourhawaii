WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU PRINT THIS FONT SOFTWARE FOR APPLICATIONS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR FURTHER REFERENCE.

This Font Software For Applications End User License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and Monotype that governs the use of the Font Software that you license from a Monotype affiliated website, and which are accompanied by or refer to this Agreement. This Agreement becomes a binding contract between you and Monotype when you click on the area marked “ACCEPT LICENSE AGREEMENT,” or similar language or when you accept the Agreement by other means (for instance referring to the Agreement in a purchase order, a confirmation email etc.). If you do not wish to be bound by the Agreement, you cannot access, Use or download the Font Software. Please read this entire Agreement before agreeing to be bound. The Agreement contains capitalized terms that are defined in Section 9 of the Agreement.

You hereby agree to the following:

1. Binding Agreement. You are bound by the Agreement and you acknowledge that all use of the Font Software sup-plied to you by Monotype for the purposes set forth under this Agreement is governed by this Agreement.

2. License Grants. You are hereby granted, during the Term and subject to all of the terms and conditions herein, a worldwide (subject to the Export section of Monotype's standard Terms and Conditions of Business), non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable (except as expressly permitted herein) license to:

• incorporate the Font Software into an iOS, Android or Windows Phone Application, in a manner in which the Font Software cannot be fully or partially extracted, provided (i) that the Application does not allow End Users to use the Font Software for authoring purposes (e.g. in an Application that provides office functionality such as word processing or presentation design or that allows users to create graphic designs or merchandising) and/or (ii) its primary purpose is not to replace the Font Software;

• duplicate the Font Software as an integral part of any such Application;

• distribute the Font Software, directly or indirectly, as an integrated component of any such Application; and

• make backup copies of the Font Software, provided that such copies are for your internal back up purposes only and remain in your exclusive control. Any copies that you are expressly permitted to make pursuant to this Agreement must contain the same copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices that appear on or in the Font Software.

Trademarks. Although use of the Trademarks is not required, if you elect to do so, you may use the Trademarks (i) in your advertising, publicity, literature, packaging and other promotional activities in connection with the Font Software incorporated into your products or materials, and (ii) to identify the Font Software that is/are embedded in or accessed through your products or materials as permitted by this Agreement, in each case subject to the requirements set forth at http://www.monotype.com/legal/trademarks/guidelines/.

3. License Limitations and Reporting.

• The maximum number of separate and distinct Applications into which the Font Software may be incorporated during the Term may not exceed the number of Applications indicated in your Account or transaction documenta-tion such as a quotation or an invoice when licensing the Font Software.

• If any Application requires its users to register to install and/or use it, all of your licensed Applications may only be distributed up to, in the aggregate, 25,000 registered users.

• Businesses or organizations such as advertising agencies, design agencies or hosting providers that are respon-sible for multiple clients’ Applications must enter into separate Agreements for each client’s Applications.

You are obligated to maintain records with respect to your Use of the Font Software against such licensed amounts and Monotype has the right to ask you, from time to time, to provide information regarding such Use amounts and/or to fully docu-ment and certify that Use of any and all Font Software at the time of the request is in conformity with your valid li-censes from Monotype, which you shall provide to us within 30 days of our request. In the event your Use of the Font Software exceeds your licensed amounts, you agree to license from Monotype the necessary additional amounts and pay any fee associated with such increase.

If the Font Software contains embedding bits that indicate that the Font Software is only authorized for certain purposes, you may not change or alter the embedding bits.

• Embed the Font Software in open source software which may have the direct or indirect effect of causing the Font Software to become Publicly Available Software or otherwise be subject to a Publicly Available Software agree-ment.
